# Causes and Risks

**Learning objectives:**

- Overview of the causes and risks related to health metrics calculation
- Identify the objective of the research question
- Learn how causal inference can be used to estimate the effect of an exposure on an outcome

## Introduction {-}

> 👉 “**Fear is the most pervasive emotion of modern society**—shaping our decisions, driving public policy, and influencing how we perceive risk. But how much of it is justified?”

![This book [Joanna Bourke, Fear: A Cultural History (Catapult, 2007)](https://www.amazon.com/Fear-Cultural-History-Joanna-Bourke/dp/1593761437) explores the history of fear and how it has shaped our society. Fear is a powerful emotion that can influence our decisions and perceptions of risk. It can be a useful tool for survival, but it can also lead to irrational behavior and poor decision-making.](images/ch5-fear.png){width=100% align=center}

## 💥 Risk Factors and Health Metrics {-}

> the likelihood that an individual will experience a specific health outcome, such as illness or injury, due to certain behaviours, exposures, or conditions.

### Risk-Specific Exposures

- smoking, physical inactivity, high blood pressure (hypertension), and others.

### Risk-Specific Outcomes

- **Injuries**: falls, accidents, violence

- **Diseases**: heart disease, stroke, cancer, liver disease, respiratory diseases, organ damage, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, malaria, chronic diseases, disabilities, hereditary diseases, certain cancers

### Risk-Specific Populations

- **Ageing**: older adults
- **Genetics**: individuals with hereditary diseases or certain cancers
- **Poverty**: individuals with limited access to healthcare and poor nutrition


### Risk Measures

- Relative Risks $RR = \frac{P(E|D)}{P(E|D^c)}$ which is the ratio of the probability of exposure among cases to the probability of exposure among non-cases.
- Theoretical Minimum-Risk Exposure Levels $TMREL = \frac{P(E|D)}{P(E|D^c)}$ which is the lowest level of exposure that would result in the lowest risk of disease.
- Population Attributable Fractions $PAF = \frac{P(D) - P(D|E)}{P(D)}$ which is the proportion of disease that would be eliminated if the exposure were removed.

## Causal Inference {-}

> 👉 “the process of drawing a conclusion about a causal connection based on the conditions of the occurrence of an effect.”
